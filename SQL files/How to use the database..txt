How to use the database.

1. Create the database "backup" in PostgreSQL
2. RightClick and select "Restore"

3. In the dialogue box:-
Format -> Custom or Tar
FileName -> Select the database file from the folder where you saved it
Number of Jobs -> [Leave it Blank]
Role Name -> Postgres
ENTER.

Refresh the database then run "SELECT * FROM annual_data" to see the annual data table. "quarterly_data" for quarterly data.

Viola!
